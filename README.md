# Stalk Me 

I travel pretty often so this is a way for my friends to figure out which city I'm in... at all times! The app uses CoreLocation to find my current location and automatically stores it in Firebase's realtime database. My website grabs this information and updates the "Stalk Me" section with the Google Maps API.
